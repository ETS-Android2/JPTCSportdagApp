  This application was created as part of our final assignment. 
  Which must have something to do with one of our main final exam subjects. 
  This idea was suggested by one of our teachers and we found it fairly interesting. 
  
  Use the source of this app in any way shape or form you want because a lot of it is based on comments
  placed on http://www.stackoverflow.com.
  
  If you ever need to know something about anything you want to use in your App just google 
  <question> android
  and look through a few posts on stackoverflow.com and you will usually find your answer there just like we did.
