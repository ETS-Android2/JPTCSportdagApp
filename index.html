            <p>This application is developed to make counting the score for several activities easier while also making it posible to show it on a monitor. 
			 This can be done with a set of pre-set sports and dynamic input from a SQL server (still looking at what type of SQL). 
			 <small>Specificaly designed for the Jac P. Thijsse College Castricum from The Netherlands.</br>
			 This is a concept, this app is only a gui there is no real backend to it.</small></p>
          
          <h2><a name="readme" class="anchor" href="#readme"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Readme</h2>
          
            <p>This application was created as part of our final assignment.
			 Which must have something to do with one of our main final exam subjects.
			  This idea was suggested by one of our teachers and we found it fairly interesting.</p>
            
            <p>Use the source of this app in any way shape or form you want because a lot of it is based on comments placed over at <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>.</p>
            
            <p>If you ever need to know something about anything you want to use in your App just google "[question] android" and look through a few posts on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> and you will usually find your answer there just like we did.</p>
