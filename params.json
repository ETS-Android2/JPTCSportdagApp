Which must have something to do with one of our main final exam subjects. This idea was suggested by one of our teachers and we found it fairly interesting.   \r\n  \r\nUse the source of this app in any way shape or form you want because a lot of it is based on comments placed over at [stackoverflow.com](http://www.stackoverflow.com).\r\n  \r\nIf you ever need to know something about anything you want to use in your App just google \"<question> android\" and look through a few posts on [stackoverflow.com](http://www.stackoverflow.com) and you will usually find your answer there just like we did.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
